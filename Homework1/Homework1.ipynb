Introspection may be helpful to figure out patterns in how an individual thinks, but it doesn't give concrete data as to the mechanisms of human thought and brain patterns. Introspection is more helpful as a tool to realize what type of things you are thinking about than a tool to figure out how thinking works.\n",
