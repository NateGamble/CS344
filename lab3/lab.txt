    a. Depth-first search and min conflicts don't work on the easy puzzle, 
        AC3 and backtracking search both work on the easy puzzle, but AC3 is much
        faster than backtracking. AC3 doesn't work on the harder puzzle. Backtracking should 
        work on the harder sudoku puzzle, but not in any amount of reasonable time (at least 5
        minutes without knowing if it's failed or suceeded)
    b.  Using just the mrv variable for the select_unassigned_variable parameter makes the
        backtracking algorithm take significantly longer on the easy puzzle, but using
        it in combination with forward_checking makes it run really fast. Using just
        forward_checking has no significant time difference from using both with the easy
        sudoku. The difference becomes quite apparent however when trying it on the harder
        puzzle. Just forward_checking runs faster than without, but it still takes a minute.
        Using both mrv and forward_checking solves the puzzle in around a second.
        Using both mrv and forward_checking solves the hardest problem really fast as well.

    a.  Min-conflicts: Very big. n=5000 took about 10 seconds
        AC3: Big, but not huge. n=300 takes about 10 seconds
        Backtracking: about 27
