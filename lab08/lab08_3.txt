The FtrlOptimizer takes in the learning rate and optimizes it for the L1 algorithm, then uses these optimizations in training the linear regressor.
Bucketing allows more accurate predictions for the linear regression models by separating columns into multiple pieces.
Their bucketing made sense, but I wish there was more concrete data about how many buckets you should use for your data (or just more clear rules of thumb). One feature cross for Task 2 could be households and median_income. This may help because it can more accurately predict how rich/poor neighborhoods are (and thus the housing price) by looking at places with high households and low median income (poor neighborhoods).
