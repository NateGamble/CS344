When you are training a Neural Network, it is important to have 3 datasets. You start using the training and validation sets to figure out the model you want to use for your data. Once you have selected the model to use, then you use the testing data to determine the accuracy of your model. You use these three different sets at different times to make sure your model doesn't overfit any of the data.
