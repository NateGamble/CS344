Hyper-parameters for exercise 1:
	learning_rate: .0001
	steps: 500
	batch_size: 500
	RMSE: 166.32
Hyper-parameters for exercise 2:
	learning_rate: .0001
	steps: 500
	batch_size: 1000
	RMSE: 175.92

The hyper-parameters learned in these exercises are batch size, steps and learning rate. There's no standard tuning algorithm for these hyper-parameters, but there are some rules of thumbs like try large batch sizes and go smaller from there.
